# Final Project - Part 3

## The Work Completed

The last leg of this project has definitley been the place where I have made the most progress. Through talking more with my peers and friends about the story told from my visualizations as well as the feedback received from the professor and teaching assistant, I was able to make some key changes to my project that have strengthened my story.
Firstly, I wanted to make the hook of my story a bit personal. Gun violence has been something that has impacted my life in several ways so I thought it would be a good strategy to share how close I have been to gun violence. I was working as an admissions ambassador at Chatham University and was giving a tour while the Tree of Life Synangogue massacre began. I heard every gunshot fired in the synagogue and this horrible experience brought one of my passions to light.

One of the main points that I wanted to hit on was the importance of mental health and the impacts mental health has on gun violence. I wanted to point out that the top intention of gun violence is suicide as well as I wanted to find more statistics on the mental status of mass shooters or those who have committed gun violence in the past. It was hard to incorporate this idea into my project so I decided to scrap it and take a different approach.
I was able to find some great data from the [Brady Project](https://www.bradyunited.org/) that talked a bit more about hate crimes and the relationship gun violence has with hate crimes. This helped me really tie in the hook of my story talking about the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting.
I created three visualizations with statistics taken from the Brady Project that showed how overtime, hate crimes are becoming more motivated by race, religion, or identity in general.

To add to the storytelling aspect, I decided to add a smooth transition into my second point, racial disparities in gun violence. I took a timeline approach and stated that just under 2 years after the Tree of Life Synagogue massacre, Breonna Taylor was shot, unarmed in her own home. This made a smooth transition into me talking a bit more about the racial disparities that are seen in gun violence.
