# Final Project - Part 3

## The Work Completed

The last leg of this project has definitley been the place where I have made the most progress. Through talking more with my peers and friends about the story told from my visualizations as well as the feedback received from the professor and teaching assistant, I was able to make some key changes to my project that have strengthened my story.
Firstly, I wanted to make the hook of my story a bit personal. Gun violence has been something that has impacted my life in several ways so I thought it would be a good strategy to share how close I have been to gun violence. I was working as an admissions ambassador at Chatham University and was giving a tour while the Tree of Life Synangogue massacre began. I heard every gunshot fired in the synagogue and this horrible experience brought one of my passions to light.

One of the main points that I wanted to hit on was the importance of mental health and the impacts mental health has on gun violence. I wanted to point out that the top intention of gun violence is suicide as well as I wanted to find more statistics on the mental status of mass shooters or those who have committed gun violence in the past. It was hard to incorporate this idea into my project so I decided to scrap it and take a different approach.
I was able to find some great data from the [Brady Project](https://www.bradyunited.org/) that talked a bit more about hate crimes and the relationship gun violence has with hate crimes. This helped me really tie in the hook of my story talking about the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting.
I created three visualizations with statistics taken from the Brady Project that showed how overtime, hate crimes are becoming more motivated by race, religion, or identity in general.

To add to the storytelling aspect, I decided to add a smooth transition into my second point, racial disparities in gun violence. I took a timeline approach and stated that just under 2 years after the Tree of Life Synagogue massacre, Breonna Taylor was shot, unarmed in her own home. This made a smooth transition into me talking a bit more about the racial disparities that are seen in gun violence. 

## Key Takeaways from Interviews and User Research

I decided to interview 3 different people about my visualizations the the story being taken away from my report. Some key demographics about the people I interviewed are as follows:
  1. 24 year old male, votes in the United States, from Pennsylvania
  2. 27 year old female, does not vote in the United States, from Taiwan
  3. 51 year old female, does vote in the United States, from Texas

I asked the following questions:
  _What do you like about this visualization?_
  _Is there anything unclear about the visualization?_
  _What message do you take away from this visualization?_
  _What are some ways to combat the problems being addressed in this report?_
  _Do you have any other questions or comments about the content in this reprt?_
  
 ### Interviewee # 1
  - I like how the key messages are highlighted. My eyes are immediately drawn to the main point and it does not take long to understand what you are trying to convey.
  - I don't really understand what you are trying to say in the visualization with the big squares. We know that suicide and homicide make up a large portion of gun    violence. What else are you trying to convey to the audience?
  - I think that some ways to combat the issues mentioned include voting and increasing awarness of the issue of gun violence

### Interviewee # 2 
  - I knew the issue of gun violence was bad in the United States, but I did not know how bad as well as the racial disparities seen.
  - I don't really understand how the mental health visualization drives your story forward. Maybe it would be good to find more data to back this claim up, or consider another route.
  - I think more research should be completed to find more disparities and see if there are root causes identified.

### Interviewee # 3
  - The story in the beginning really grabs the audience's attention.
  - I would consider placing the pie chart in the middle of the grid on the section about hate crimes.
  - I like how attention is immediately drawn to the goal of the graph by using a highlighting color.
  - I think the disarm hate act needs to be implemented to decrease the relevance of gun violence in our society. Along with this, the minimum age should be raised and assault rifles should be banned.

### Conclusion from User Research
Overall, the user research showed me that my visualizations are strong, but I need to touch up a few parts of my stories to help them flow a bit better. I had a section about mental health and the user research confirmed that maybe it will be difficult to tie this very important part into this specific story. For now, I think I am going to take a different approach. 
I also used the user research to help me develop a call to action. I learned more about a key piece of legislation that I want to include as well as my other two ideas of more research and voting have been confirmed in the interview.
