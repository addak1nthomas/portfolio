# About Me
I am a second year graduate student in the MS in Healthcare Policy and Management at Heinz College within Carnegie Mellon University. I originally come from Houston, TX, but consider Pittsburgh to be my home now. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, exercise, and music.

# What I Hope to Learn
In this course, I hope the learn more about the effective methods of communicating data via visualization to one who may be unfamiliar with the topics being depicted. I am hoping to persue a career in management consulting, so it is important I am able to communicate insights effectively.
