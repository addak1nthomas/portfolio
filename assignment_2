The chart above was is a subset of the data from part 1. I decided to remove the other countries that were not highlighted in the initial data from the OECD chart. I noticed that the first visualization was attempting to show the debt to GDP ratio of the member countries of G7. Because of this, I decided to remove the other countries not being highlighted to avoid distracting information. 
Because we are in the United States and I am most interested in conveying the ratios of the United States, I decided to go ahead and grey out the other 6 member countries of G7. This is an effective strategy as it really allows for the United States to stand out and the viewers eyes are immediately drawn to the trends that are occuring in the United States.
